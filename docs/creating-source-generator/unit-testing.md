# Unit testing generation steps

If each non-trivial step of generation is isolated, you can independently test it.

## Creating code for testing

In order to test you need samples that exercise your generator in specific ways

## Capturing the initial syntax nodes

You do not need to unit test the initial capture of syntax nodes 

## Unit testing the initial filtering predicate

## Unit testing the initial transform

## Unit testing further transformation

## Unit testing code output
