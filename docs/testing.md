# Testing Roslyn incremental source generators

There are several kinds of testing for Roslyn incremental source generators:

1. Unit tests.
2. Tests via a generator.
3. Tests to validate created code compiles.
4. Tests that created code runs correctly.
5. Performance tests.

## Unit tests

Allow you to test individual methods used in generation by creating the r

### Creating syntax nodes

### Creating a semantic model

### Creating a generation data model

### Testing code output

## Tests via a generator

### Creating a generator

Reference assemblies and options

## Tests to validate created code compiles

### Integration test using your example project

### Compiling via a process

### Testing with multiple examples

## Tests that created code runs correctly

### Ordered tests or redundant work

### Running code in a process

## Performance tests
