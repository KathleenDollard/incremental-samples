# Tips for creating generators

## Overall

### Let compiler and separate analyzers report diagnostics

### Managing VS versions and new APIs :(

### Patience

### Keep generator types out of your implementation code

for testing, example `GetModelFromAttribute`

## Troubleshooting

### One or more steps of the generator do not run

The steps of the pipeline are optimized, and if values are not used, they are not created. Check that output depends on the missing steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When no generation is performed based on an incremental value(s) provider, it is not created. While this is generally not observable because generators should not have side effects other than generation, this may be confusing if you expect to hit breakpoints. This can occur either because there is no code output because you are early in development, or because there is only `RegisterImplementationSourceOutput` output.


## Code called in the generator pipeline must be pure

What is purity

Coming out of the pipeline doesn't count

## Resolve warnings in your generated code

Aggressive warnings - particularly nullability and XML comments

## Use diagnostics and do not throw exceptions

Usability

## `WhereNotNull` method

to avoid nullability warning

## Creating an effective dev inner loop

## Attributes in `RegisterPostInitializationOutput` or a separate package

## Backwards compatibility and the Roslyn API

## Place #nullable enable into your generated file

## Run with aggressive warnings and include XmlComments
