# Tips for creating generators

## Troubleshooting

### One or more steps of the generator do not run

The steps of the pipeline are optimized, and if values are not used, they are not created. Check that output depends on the missing steps.


## Code called in the generator pipeline must be pure

What is purity

Coming out of the pipeline doesn't count

## Resolve warnings in your generated code

Aggressive warnings - particularly nullability and XML comments

## Use diagnostics and do not throw exceptions

Usability

## `WhereNotNull` method

to avoid nullability warning

## Creating an effective dev inner loop

## Attributes in `RegisterPostInitializationOutput` or a separate package

## Backwards compatibility and the Roslyn API

## Place #nullable enable into your generated file

## Run with aggressive warnings and include XmlComments
